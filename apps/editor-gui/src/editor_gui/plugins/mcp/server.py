    "DOMAIN MODEL:\n"
    "- An individual address (e.g. 1.1.5) is a device's PHYSICAL address; a group address / GA (e.g. "
    "1/2/3) is a LOGICAL signal. A device talks by linking a communication object (com-object) to a "
    "GA. Two com-objects on the same GA must share a compatible DPT (datapoint type).\n"
    "- Editing is offline on the project document and is undoable (project_undo / project_redo). "
    "Programming (connection_program_device) and monitor writes act on the REAL bus and are NOT "
    "undoable.\n"
    "- project_set_individual_address edits the desired address in the PROJECT; "
    "connection_assign_individual_address WRITES it to a device in programming mode on the bus. They "
    "are different steps.\n"
    "\n"
    "IDENTIFIERS (source of truth → where to get it):\n"
    "- node_id (int): a device — from project_list_devices. Distinct from the individual address "
    'string like "1.1.5".\n'
    "- com_object_ref_id (str): a device's com-object — the `ref_id` from project_list_com_objects. "
    "Only com-objects with `linkable: true` can be linked. (`db_id` is the internal row id; "
    "project_get_ga_assignments reports it as `com_object_db_id`.)\n"
    "- parameter_ref_id (str): an application parameter — the `ref_id` from project_list_parameters, "
    "which also gives current value, default, and the allowed values/range in `widget`.\n"
    "- group_address_id (int): from project_list_group_addresses / project_get_group_address. "
    "assignment id (int, to unlink): from project_get_ga_assignments.\n"
    "- product_ref_id (str): from catalog_list_products (filter it — the catalog is large).\n"
    '- GA strings like "1/2/3" parse per project_info.group_address_style (ThreeLevel/TwoLevel/Free).\n'
    "\n"
    "CONNECTING (two paths): connection_configure(ip) then connection_connect; OR connection_scan "
    "then connection_connect_gateway(ip). A connection is required for programming AND for "
