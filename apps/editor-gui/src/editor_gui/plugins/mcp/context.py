"""Shared context and helpers for the embedded MCP server's tool modules.

The MCP server runs on its own thread (uvicorn), but the GUI's ``project``/``catalog`` services wrap
non-thread-safe SQLAlchemy sessions and per-frame caches. Every tool that touches them therefore
runs its body on the imgui main thread via :attr:`McpContext.run_on_ui` (a
:class:`~editor_gui.concurrency.MainThreadExecutor`), which serialises MCP access with the GUI's own
per-frame reads and writes. Bus operations instead go through the connection service, which already
schedules onto the KNX event loop thread-safely and returns a ``concurrent.futures.Future``.
