"""Recover-plugin service: scan the bus, identify devices, read them back, add to a project.

Bus work (scan, identify, read-back) runs on the connection's asyncio loop via
``api.connection.run_async``; the resulting :class:`RecoverEntry` list is polled on
the UI thread. Writing recovered devices into a project happens on the UI thread
through :class:`ProjectService` (which is not thread-safe). All bus access is
read-only.
