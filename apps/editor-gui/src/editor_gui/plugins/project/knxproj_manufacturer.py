"""Collect the manufacturer archive members a ``.knxproj`` export needs to bundle.

``xknxeditor-proj`` is catalog-free, so its :func:`~xknxeditor.proj.export_knxproj` writes only the
project structure. To make the archive self-contained (applications resolvable), the GUI — which has
the catalog — re-extracts each used manufacturer's ``M-XXXX/`` tree (Hardware/Catalog/application
program XMLs, baggages) and its ``M-XXXX.signature`` from the original ``.knxprod`` the device was
imported from, and merges those archives' ``knx_master.xml`` into one. The result is passed to
``export_knxproj(..., extra_files=..., master_xml=...)``.

The original ``.knxprod`` files must still exist at the paths the catalog recorded; refs that can't
be resolved are reported in :attr:`ManufacturerBundle.skipped_refs` and simply left out.

    Genuine ``knx_master.xml`` carries a ``MasterData`` ``Signature`` over its exact bytes, and the
