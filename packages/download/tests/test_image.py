    declares the table's full capacity (here 513 octets) while the image segment holds
    only the few used entries. ``masked_writes`` must still return the (clipped) image
    run, not ``None`` - requiring full containment made it report the range as missing,
    so the write path (``_abs_segment``'s ``if runs``) and the preflight silently skipped
    the association table and the device kept its stale group-address links, so
    re-linked com-objects sent nothing on the bus.
