"""Build the group communication tables for the System B device model.

Same three tables as :mod:`.tables` (KNX Standard v3.0.0, Chapter 3/5/1
"Resources", sections 4.16 "Group Address Table (GrAT)", 4.17 "Group Object
Association Table (GrOAT)" and 4.18 "Group Object Table"), but in the System B
realisation - the mask 57B0h configuration procedure (Chapter 3/5/3
"Configuration Procedures", section 3.9.3) - which holds them in object relative
memory with a 2-octet count layout (validated byte-exact against real hardware):

- the group address table is ``[count:2][group address:2]*`` (big-endian), the
  count being the number of addresses. Unlike the memory-mapped variant it does
  *not* lead with the device's own individual address;
- the association table is ``[count:2]`` followed by one entry per link, each
  ``[group address index + 1 : 1][group object number : 1]`` (a wide variant uses
  two octets per field);
- the group object table is ``[count:2 = highest object number]`` followed by one
  ``[flags:1][size code:1]`` record per object number ``1..highest``. Only linked
  objects carry their flags and size; every other slot stays ``00 00``.

All three live in relative memory (addressed through the object's table
reference), not at fixed addresses. See :mod:`.tables` for the memory-mapped
model and the shared :class:`~.tables.Association` and flag/size helpers.
