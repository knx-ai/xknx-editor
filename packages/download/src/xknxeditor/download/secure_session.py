"""Open a Tool-Key secured point-to-point session for a download.

Wraps a point-to-point connection so that all its management traffic is KNX
Data Secure protected with the device's Tool Key: it installs
:class:`ToolKeyCemiSecure` on ``xknx.cemi_handler.data_secure`` (the same hook
xknx uses for group Data Secure, where each frame's transport-layer sequence
number is already assigned), opens the connection and runs the S-A_Sync
exchange, then restores the previous hook when the connection closes.

The :class:`DeviceProgrammer` sees a plain :class:`BusConnection`; securing and
unwrapping happen transparently on the CEMI path underneath it.
