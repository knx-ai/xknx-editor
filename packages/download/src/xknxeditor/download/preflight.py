"""Read-only pre-flight check: what a download would change on the device.

Before writing anything, walk the resolved Load Procedure and, for every control
that would write, read the device's current bytes and compare them against the
data the download would write. Nothing is written and no load state is changed -
only reads (memory, properties, table references, object lookup) happen, plus the
procedure's own compare controls, which act as a fingerprint gate.

The resulting :class:`PreflightReport` lists, per memory segment and per property,
how many bytes would change (and the changed ranges), so an operator can confirm a
download does what they expect before committing it to hardware.
