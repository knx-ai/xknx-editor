"""KNX Data Secure for point-to-point programming (Tool Key access).

Secures the management telegrams of a download run following KNX Standard
v3.0.0, 3/3/7 section 5 (the Secure Application Layer): S-A_Data in 5.3.1,
S-A_Sync in 5.3.2. Tool Key access (SCF ``Tool Access`` bit set) is the mode
used for device programming: the device accepts frames from any tool
address secured with the Tool Key, so no key table has to be provisioned.

The CCM building blocks (B0, Ctr0, the AES-CBC-MAC and AES-CTR steps) are laid
out here per KNX 3/3/7 sections 5.1.3.2 and Annex A, and the AES steps
themselves are taken from xknx's ``security_primitives``. The construction is
verified byte-for-byte against the worked examples in 3/3/7 Annex C
(C.1.1-C.1.4). It is deliberately *not* delegated to xknx's
``SecureData.init_from_plain_apdu``: that path only handles secure group
communication and gets two things wrong for point-to-point programming - it
puts only the SCF into the additional data ``A`` (the S-A_Sync request needs
``SCF | KNX Serial Number``) and its B0 TPCI/APCI octet is only correct for a
zero TPCI, so it cannot encode the connection-oriented frames the download uses.

Each B0/Ctr0 is built from a ``CEMILData`` derived from the telegram, so the
source/destination address, the address-type octet and the TPCI octet are
exactly what the frame carries on the wire. Both sides recompute the same
blocks from the frame's own fields.

Because the S-AL state on the device advances with the Sequence Number of an
accepted frame, the session's Sequence Numbers are first synchronised with an
S-A_Sync request before the first S-A_Data frame - the step the programmer performs
(DM_SecureSync, 3/5/2).
