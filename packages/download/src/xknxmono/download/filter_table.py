"""KNX line/backbone coupler filter table: the routing bitmap, its computation, and read-back.

A coupler's filter table is a 65536-bit bitmap (8192 bytes) over the whole 16-bit group-address raw
value space (KNX Standard v3.0.0, coupler/router group-address filtering): a set bit means "route
this group address across the coupler", a clear bit means "block". It is indexed strictly by the
flat raw value, LSB-first within each byte::

    byte offset = ga >> 3          bit mask = 1 << (ga & 7)

Which group addresses a coupler must route (``routed_group_addresses``): a group address crosses a
coupler iff at least one device *behind* the coupler and at least one device *outside* it link that
address, plus any address flagged "unfiltered" (route regardless) and any manually added
pass-through address.

Short/older couplers store only the first N bytes their filter resource holds (BCU1 coupler MV-0900
= 3584 bytes = the first 28672 group addresses); System-B couplers hold the full 8192.
