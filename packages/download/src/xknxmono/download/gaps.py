"""Registry of Load Controls this engine does not execute yet.

The KNX Standard v3.0.0 (Chapter 2/3/1 "Load Controls" and the Application Layer
services in 3/3/7) plus the ETS load procedure define more Load Controls than
this engine currently implements. When the runner meets one it fails - or, in a
read-only preflight, logs - a message that names the KNX Standard service the
control maps to. That way a bug report shows exactly which piece of the
implementation is missing instead of an opaque class name.

Keep :data:`KNOWN_GAPS` in sync with :mod:`xknxmono.download.procedure`: a control
handled in ``LoadProcedureRunner._execute`` must not appear here, and a control
that appears here must not be silently accepted anywhere.
