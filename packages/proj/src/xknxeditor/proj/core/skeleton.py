"""Lay down a new project's baseline, matching a fresh project's starting state.

The baseline is not undoable, so it goes in directly (no event): a ``Project`` row (``ThreeLevel``
style) plus installation 0 with the default KNX topology, a default building, and an empty
group-address tree.

The topology follows the KNX standard for a fresh project: an IP backbone (Area 0 / Line 0, ``0.0``),
plus Area 1 with an IP main line (``1.0``) and a TP line (``1.1``) where end devices belong. New
devices default onto the TP line ``1.1`` (KNX best practice: backbone and main line carry only
couplers, not end devices). The building tree starts with one ``Building`` named after the project.
