"""MDT DALI gateway (GC16/Hawk) bus commissioning over KNX.

Reverse-engineered from the MDT DALI DCA. Layers on ``xknxeditor.download``'s property access to scan
the DALI bus, identify ballasts, download group/ECG assignment and write scenes — the parts ETS does
through its DCA plugin. Manufacturer-specific (MDT); verify against real hardware.
