"""Round-trip verification of a recovered device against the bus.

Re-encodes the recovered group communication and compares it, read-only, to what
is actually on the device using :func:`xknxeditor.download.preflight`. A clean result
(zero changed bytes) means the reconstruction re-encodes exactly to the device's
tables - a strong correctness signal. Verification is limited to the group
communication scope: re-encoding parameters would drive the product evaluator with
values for possibly-inactive references, which is exactly the fragile path recovery
avoids, so parameter round-tripping is intentionally not attempted here.
