"""Discover devices on a KNX line by probing an individual-address range.

There is no line-enumeration service in the KNX Application Layer, so discovery
is done by opening a point-to-point connection to each candidate individual
address and reading its device descriptor (A_DeviceDescriptor_Read type 0, KNX
Standard v3.0.0 3/3/7 section 3.4.2.1). An address that answers hosts a device;
one that times out (or refuses the connection) does not. The scan is read-only.
